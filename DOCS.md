### get_currency_icons.py
Script that automatically downloads icons of all currencies from a given category (provided by a valid url to poe2scout.com API). <br>
File names of icons are set as 'apiId' of each currency so that it's then easier to match them later in the item_emojis file. <br>
To run the script you have to: <br> 
```python get_currency_icons.py <path_to_folder> <poe2scout_api_url>```
